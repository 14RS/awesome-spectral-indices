Spectral Indices by Type
============================

.. note::
   All spectral indices listed here are considered broad-band spectral indices. Narrow-band spectral indices are coerced to the closest broad-band spectrum.

Kernel

.. warning::
   All kernel indices listed here were extracted from the `Supplementary Material <http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/7/9/eabc7447/DC1>`_ of `Camps-Valls et al., 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc7447>`_. Please note that the kEVI and kVARI indices may have more than one implementation, but for simplicity, just one is presented here.
